# Medical Simulation
This project  focused on enhancing a virtual medical simulation designed to depict interactions with medical tools and human organs.
It uses the Glitter project as a starting point. 

The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive VR medical simulation system that is capable of providing a realistic and immersive experience for medical students. 

To achieve this goal, I have implemented a number of features and components, to the shader, model, camera, and mesh classes. 
These components are designed to also allowing for easy customization and scalability. 

Furthermore, I have also implemented a number of optimization techniques to ensure that the simulation runs smoothly and efficiently.
